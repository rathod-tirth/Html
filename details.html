        <summary>Lamborgini Revoulto</summary>
        <p>The Lamborghini Revuelto is the sixth mid-engine V-12 flagship in the brand's history, replacing the
            Aventador after its unending 11 year production run. The new supercar is centered around an updated version
            of the brand's forged carbon monocoque, now 10 percent lighter and 25 percent stiffer than the outgoing
            unit. Tucked behind the driver sits a naturally-aspirated 6.5-liter V-12 engine, though it's not the same
            motor that we've grown accustomed to. Lamborghini developed an entirely new engine block for Revuelto, as
            well as other hardware improvements to the valvetrain and rotating assembly. The motor alone provides 813
            horsepower at 9250 rpm, but can rev all the way up to 9500 rpm for good measure.</p>
